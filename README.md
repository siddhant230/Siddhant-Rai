In addition to that I am also conducting research under [Prof. Mrityunjay Singh](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=5kG-VWMAAAAJ) where I am working on an *Optimized Search Engine*(which is a govt. funded research project). I am also planning to represent Govt. of India in *Inter-ASEAN comptetion* for *Face Detection System for Criminals* which I cleared through attaining the *first position in the World's Biggest Hackathon, i.e. Smart India Hackathon*. One of my research papers on *Recommendation Engine* is under review in the [Information Sciences](https://www.journals.elsevier.com/information-sciences) journal.
